ut2tm is a script for migrating µTorrent resume data to transmission.

 * The script takes two paths as arguments, your µTorrent data
   directory (%appdata%\uTorrent - copy it to your linux system)
   and an output directory (usually ~/.config/transmission-daemon).
   The output directory will be created if it does not exist.

 * If you need to change the base download directory, it is recommended
   to do so before using this tool, using search & replace in BEncode
   Editor (https://sites.google.com/site/ultimasites/bencode-editor/).

 * Dependencies: python, pyrobase (easy_install pyrobase)

Issues/Limitations:

 * Currently, there is only support for µTorrent for Windows.

 * Transmission does not support changing the name of the downloaded
   file/directory. Torrents where this has been done will be forcibly
   paused.
